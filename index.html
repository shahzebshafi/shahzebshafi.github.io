            <p>Designed a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from
                the Fashion MNIST dataset, which achieves over 90% test accuracy. Optimized the model by implementing
                data preprocessing, normalization, and one-hot encoding</p>

            <h4>User-Level Thread Library</h4>
            <a href="https://github.com/shahzebshafi/User-Thread-Library" class = "project-link">View Project</a>
            <p>Developed a user-level thread library in C that enables concurrent execution of multiple tasks within a single process. 
                The library features a preemptive round-robin scheduler that uses timer interrupts to switch between threads, allowing 
                for fair CPU time distribution without relying on the operating system's kernel threads. To manage synchronization and avoid 
                race conditions, I implemented semaphores, enabling safe coordination between threads.</p>

            <h4>Personal Blog</h4>
            <a href ="#" class = "project-link">View Project</a>
            <p>Built a Full-stack microblogging platform using Express.js, SQLite, and JavaScript that allows users to post and interact with short 
                messages. The app features secure Google OAuth 2.0 authentication, enabling users to log in with their Google accounts, with user data 
                stored in a local SQLite database. I designed a custom backend with RESTful APIs to handle post creation, deletion, and user sessions, and 
                integrated an external emoji API to enhance post content with emojis. </p>
